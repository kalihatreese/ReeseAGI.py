# ReeseAGI

## Overview

The `ReeseAGI.py` module provides an implementation of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. It includes components for knowledge representation, reasoning, self-improvement, quantum processing, and decision-making.

## Features

- **KnowledgeGraph**: Represents entities and relationships, supports updating and querying.
- **ReasoningEngine**: Draws conclusions from input data, applies rules, and makes decisions ('BUY' or 'SELL').
- **SelfImprovementMechanism**: Evaluates performance metrics (accuracy) and adjusts system parameters or knowledge graph.
- **QuantumAIComponent**: Simulates quantum processing to enhance decision-making capabilities.
- **CognitiveArchitecture**: Integrates all components to process input data and optimize decision-making.

## Installation

No installation is required; simply import `ReeseAGI.py` into your Python environment.

```python
from ReeseAGI import SuperIntelligence

Instantiate SuperIntelligence from ReeseAGI.py and utilize its methods to process input data, make decisions, and evaluate performance.from ReeseAGI import SuperIntelligence

# Create an instance of SuperIntelligence
si = SuperIntelligence()

# Example usage
input_data = {
    'entities': [
        {'id': 'AAPL', 'properties': ['high', 'low', 'close'], 'relationships': [{'id': '1', 'type': 'causes', 'target': 'buy'}]}
    ],
    'outcome': 'profit'
}

decision = si.process_input(input_data)
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
print(f"Accuracy: {si.get_accuracy():.2f}")
