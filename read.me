# ReeseAGI

## Overview

The `ReeseAGI.py` module provides an implementation of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. It includes components for knowledge representation, reasoning, self-improvement, quantum processing, and decision-making.

## Features

- **KnowledgeGraph**: Represents entities and relationships, supports updating and querying.
- **ReasoningEngine**: Draws conclusions from input data, applies rules, and makes decisions ('BUY' or 'SELL').
- **SelfImprovementMechanism**: Evaluates performance metrics (accuracy) and adjusts system parameters or knowledge graph.
- **QuantumAIComponent**: Simulates quantum processing to enhance decision-making capabilities.
- **CognitiveArchitecture**: Integrates all components to process input data and optimize decision-making.

## Installation

No installation is required; simply import `ReeseAGI.py` into your Python environment.

```python
from ReeseAGI import SuperIntelligence
